# US-Census-Data-Visualization
This web app allows users to search for any American city and view a data visualization of that city's demographics based on statistics from the United States Census Bureau.

A user can search for any American city in the Census data and will receive four sleek graphical results that show the following:
  * General Population Information
  * Racial Demographics
  * Political Voting History
  * Income Distribution
  
The US Census Bureau collects a plethora of data regarding America's demographics but the bureau doesn't always provide tools to easily navigate and analyze its datasets. Our project utilizes a comprehensive July 2009 dataset that hasn't previously been incorporated into any kind of data visualization tool.

Going forward, our team's goal is to utilize additional public datasets so that we can create a better comprehensive tool to analyze government data than the existing tools created by the bureau. Researchers and businesses have routinely leveraged public data to reach new social insights and make smarter business decisions; we hope to help these groups by creating a superior tool for analyzing American political, economic, and social characteristics.
